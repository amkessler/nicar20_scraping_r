# Web Scraping with R

Python is the go-to among data journalists for web-scraping, and for good reaons. But it's not the only tool. Web scraping can be easy in R too. Plus you get to enjoy other advantages of R such as data visualization.

This is a session for NICAR 2020 and teachs how to use R library Rvest to scrape data from the web. 

During the sessioin, I will walk through how to scrape a table of OSHA inspections, including additional tables hidden behind hyperlinks, extract information based on style of the text. In the process I will introduce what webpage is and how to find CSS selector by inspecting the source code. I will also offer some tips on how to deal with errors. (Trust me you will need this)

As homework, I ask you to try scraping several hundred comment letters for a proposed federal rule.

This session will be the best for someone with some knowledge of R, including data types, subsetting a dataframe, piping (%>%) and how to create a basic function. Knowledge with HTML/CSS is helpful but not necessary.
