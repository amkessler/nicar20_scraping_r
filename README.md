# Web Scraping with R

This is a session for NICAR 2020 and teachs how to use R library Rvest to scrape data from the web. 

During the sessioin, I will walk through how to scrape a table of OSHA inspections, including additional tables hidden behind hyperlinks, extract information based on style of the text. 

As homework, I ask you to think about how to scrape several hundred comment letters for a proposed federal rule. My solution is provided.

This session will be the best for someone with some knowledge of R, including data types, subsetting a dataframe, piping (%>%) and function.
